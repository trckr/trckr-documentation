# Code

This part of the documentation is used to explain important or complex code sections of both the front- and backend of trckr.

## Backend 

The code for the backend application, which provideds an API to be consumed by the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/trckr/trckr-backend). The backend is based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/). 

More information will follow as we continue to build the application.
