# Principles

This part of the documentation gives an overview of the used software development principles in the trckr project.

## SOLID

The main principle we use in our project is SOLID:

*Single responsibility principle
a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).

*Open/closed principle
"software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

*Liskov substitution principle
"objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

*Interface segregation principle
"many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

*Dependency inversion principle
one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

## DRY

Furthermore it is very important to follow the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle:
