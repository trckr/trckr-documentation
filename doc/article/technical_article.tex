  The backend is written in Python with the help of the web application
  framework Django and the frontend with the Javascript UI framework Vue.js.
  Both technologies were new to most team members, but have proven themselves

  project.

  In order to compete with similar tools and web services, trckr focuses on
  performance and usability. To distinguish trckr from the competition, many
  features are planned to manage projects and tasks in a user-friendly manner.
  This will allow the user to leverage trckr to handle the ever increasing
  complexity in project management and task tracking found in large companies.
  Despite being targeted at large companies, trckr will remain open source and
  anybody can contribute, covering cases we might have never dreamehttps://www.theverge.com/d of.

\section{Introduction}
Time and task tracking are important activities in many businesses to gain
insights on the productivity of a team, requiring appropriate tools allowing
easier and more accurate time tracking. Many processes and methods have been
developed in the past to cover this need. Unfortunately most of them address
just a certain need or have been fine tuned to a specific company or team. This
necessarily leads to a loss of experience that could have been leveraged by
other teams but is also not generic enough to adapt to different processes,
causing other companies to inappropriately adapt to the tool instead of the tool
adapting to the company.

\subsection{Objectives}
The goal with trckr is to develop and distribute a time tracking web application
that is easy to understand and use. The most important requirement is to
require just a few steps to track all the required information. Only this will
keep the user engaged and raise the accuracy of the provided data.

\subsection{Main Features}
The user is able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item register and login to trckr
    \item create and edit projects
    \item create, track and edit tasks
    \item visit trckr on any device
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture}
The trckr project consists of two separate applications. The business and data layer are  handled by the backend application, while the presentation layer is implemented through the frontend application. The backend provides a RESTful API, which is used by the frontend application to read and write the necessary data.

This separation of concerns, achieved through the clear decoupling between the frontend and backend, allows for easy extensibility and fast development cycles. Additionally one backend is able to serve multiple client applications, without any further work required.

\section{Technologies}
\subsection{Django}
Django is an open source web framework written in Python.\cite{django} It encourages fast,
clean and simple development of web applications. One of the main advantages is
it's fast setup, enabling the developer to create applications swiftly through
it's Model-View-Presenter scheme. Django also comes with support for various
databases. Many users compare Django to Ruby On Rails but written in Python.
Django also follows the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).

\subsection{PostgreSQL}
PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database.\cite{postgre} The database is used to store all the data for trckr. PostgreSQL is fully
supported by Django and requires minimal configuration. The communication between the web application and the database is done through Django's model layer.

\subsection{Docker}
Docker is a containerization platform, which adds an abstraction layer between the application environement and the underlying server infrastruture.\cite{docker} This means that the whole backend environment can be setup inside multiple docker containers, that can be run locally as well as on the server. 

\subsection{Node.js}
Node.js is a Javascript runtime, which brings Javascript to the server environment.\cite{nodejs} It uses an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model for maximum efficiency, while still remaining lightweight. This makes node.js the ideal technology to implement the server side of the trckr frontend application.

\subsection{Vue.js}
Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.\cite{vuejs}
Vue.js is used for trckr mainly for its simplicity and the rather shallow
learning curve it provides to unexperienced developers. The features that Vue.js
provides allow the creation of data structures that can easily be displayed in
on a website. This and the ability to easily make calls to the backend make it a
good fit for trckr.

\section{Results}
The architecture was kept fairly simple, while still providing a clear seperation of concerns as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:architecture}, using Django with PostgreSQL in the backend and a
frontend based around Vue.js.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{architecture}
    \caption{Architecture of trckr}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{API}
The backend of the trckr application implements a RESTful API using the Django
REST framework. The API provides basic CRUD operations for all the entities
available in the database. There are five main endpoints to retrieve and save
data on the server: authentication, user, projects, tasks and time entries. Except
for the authentication and user endpoints, all endpoints need an authentication
token to be accessed.

\subsubsection{Endpoints}
\begin{description}
\item[authentication] allows users to retrieve an authentication token from the
  server to access the other parts of the API. Via this endpoint, one can also
  invalidate the token.
\item[user] is only used to create new user accounts.
\item[projects] lets user create, read, update and delete projects as well as
  display all the tasks associated with a project.
\item[task] used to create, read and update tasks for a given project. There
  also exits a way to list all relevant time entries for a task.
\item[time entries] also used for create, read, update and delete operations
\end{description}

Each object of an entity has a unique ID. This ID can be used to retrieve
information for that specific object by providing it in the URL when calling the
server. This is necessary when updating an object via a POST request.

\subsection{User Interface}

% TODO: Check figures and references for mismatches

When opening the trckr website the first time you are presented with the login
screen as shown in figure \ref{fig:trckr-login}. For users who have not yet
registered an account, this can be done here by entering some basic information
like username, password, email address and first and last name (Figure
\ref{fig:trckr-register}).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{trckr-login}
    \caption{The trckr login page.}
    \label{fig:trckr-login}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{trckr-register}
    \caption{The trckr registration page.}
    \label{fig:trckr-register}
\end{figure}

Once the registration process has been completed, the
user can log in at the login page. Once the user is logged in, the navigation
bar at the top of the interface will contain links to the dashboard, the
projects page and the time entries page as well as a logout button. The dashboard
displays different graphs to provide the user with a visual overview over their recent activities.
This way the user can easily see, how much time was already tracked for each task and it enables
the user to quickly proceed with their work, whithout having to search for a relevant task.
% TODO include figure once the dashboard is finished...

The projects page shows a table of all projects that the currently logged in
user is a part of, seen in figure \ref{fig:trckr-project-page}. There is a
search box above the projects list that allows a user to filter for a project or
a group of projects containing the given keywords. To create a new project the
user will have to navigate to the projects page and click on the "Create
project" link which will open the project creation form. % please add figure
The form asks for the name of the project and optionally allows the user to enter an
description.

Each project can be viewed in more detail when the project inside the table is
clicked, as shown in figure \ref{fig:trckr-project-page}. The project page
contains the name, the description and a table of all the tasks in the selected
project.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{trckr-projects-table}
    \caption{The projects page.}
    \label{fig:trckr-projects-table}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{trckr-project-page}
    \caption{The projects page with the table of all projects.}
    \label{fig:trckr-project-page}
\end{figure}

Clicking on a task will display it's details like the name and description of
the task. On the "Time Entries" page a user can create a time entry for a
specific task of a project with the entry form shown in figure
\ref{fig:trckr-create-time-entry}. The form asks the user to first choose a
project and then a task of the project for which the time entry should be
created.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{trckr-project-page}
    \caption{The form to add a time entry to a task.}
    \label{fig:trckr-create-time-entry}
\end{figure}

All time entries will be displayed on the time entry page.

\section{Conclusion}
The aim of project trckr was to create a tool, which helps people track their
time on projects. With the help of Django in the frontend and vuejs in the
frontend, we developed a webapp with modern approaches and software developing
methods. To integrate trckr into our productive environement, we used circleci,
a very useful and automated integration tool. It helped us during the development
phase target and solve bugs and other errors.

Getting started with vuejs was easy and fast for everyone, so developing single
modules for the frontend was without big effort, beside testing.
