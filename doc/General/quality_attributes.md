# Quality Attributes / Non-Functional Requirements

This section of the trckr documentation describes the quality attributes and non-functional requirements of the application.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Fast and reliable.
* Totally scalable from small businesses to big enterprises.
* Secure through self-hosting.


TODO: Go more in depth about the non-functional requirements in each chapter

## Performance

## Scalability

## Availability
Trckr is available as long as the machine that is running the trckr frontend and the trckr backend is available. This shifts the responsibility of high availability to the local admin that is responsible for the trckr environment.

## Extensibility

## Security
Trckr ensures security for the users through self-hosting by every user or their team. This approach in addition with the open-source nature of trckr will ensure every deployment to be adaptable and extendable by the users hosting it. Trckr itself can also be adapted to plug in to an already existing user database.

## Auditing

## User-friendliness
The goal is that every new user can use trckr within minutes and adapt to the interface with no hickups. The processes and workflows of the user and the team shouldn't be changed by using trckr, but instead should be enhanced by it, improving the quality of life.
