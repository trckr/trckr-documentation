# Trckr

This is the documentation of the trckr application. We develop the application for the PSIT4 module of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW).

## Our Vision

Trckr is a unique time tracking tool which stands out from the competition with an intuitive user interface and a focus on business features. In addition to the easy to use and project-oriented time tracking, Trckr offers features for teams to distribute tasks between users and respond proactively to time delays. We offer great value from the self-employed up to large teams for little effort.
